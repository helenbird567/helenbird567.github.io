# Services We Provide

## Inventory & Schedule of Condition Assessment
An inventory and schedule of condition assessment is a detailed report of the property's current state. It includes a comprehensive list of all items, fixtures, fittings, and their conditions. This assessment is crucial for establishing a baseline before tenants move in, helping to prevent disputes over property conditions at the end of the tenancy.

## Check In
Our check-in service involves a thorough inspection of the property at the start of a tenancy. We document the condition of the property, hand over keys, and ensure that all parties agree on the inventory report. This process helps ensure transparency and trust between landlords and tenants.

## Interim Inspections
Interim inspections are periodic checks conducted during the tenancy to ensure that the property is being maintained properly. These inspections help identify any issues early, ensuring they are addressed promptly to prevent further damage or disputes.

## Final Inspection & Check Out Report
The final inspection and check out report is conducted at the end of the tenancy. We compare the property's condition against the initial inventory and schedule of condition assessment. This report helps to fairly allocate any necessary charges for repairs or cleaning, ensuring a smooth and dispute-free end to the tenancy.

## Snagging Report
A snagging report is a detailed inspection of a new build property to identify any defects or incomplete works. This report ensures that all issues are documented and addressed by the developer before the property is handed over to the owner or tenant.

## Vacant Property Inspections
Vacant property inspections involve regular checks on unoccupied properties to ensure they remain secure and in good condition. These inspections help to identify and address issues such as vandalism, weather damage, or unauthorized occupancy, providing peace of mind to property owners.
